Variable Naming Rules
Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
Variable names must start with a letter or underscore.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
Avoid using Python keywords as variable names (e.g., 
print, if, else).


Data Types in Python
Python supports several built-in data types:

Integers (int): Whole numbers (e.g., 10, -5).
Floats (float): Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -0.001).
Strings (str): Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., "Hello", 'Python').
Booleans (bool): Represents True or False.
Lists: Ordered, mutable collections (e.g., [1, 2, 3]).
Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).
Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3}).
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}).
